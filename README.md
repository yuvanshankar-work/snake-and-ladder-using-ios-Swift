The Snake and Ladder game developed in Swift for iOS is a digital adaptation of the classic board game, designed to deliver both fun and interactivity on mobile devices. Built using Swift and SwiftUI/UIKit frameworks, the app provides an intuitive user interface with smooth animations and responsive gameplay. The game board is rendered programmatically with a grid of 100 squares, and snakes and ladders are positioned in their traditional manner. Players move across the board by rolling a virtual dice, which is implemented using random number generation in Swift, ensuring fairness and unpredictability.

The core game logic handles movement rules, detecting when a player lands on a ladder to climb upward or on a snake to slide downward. State management is achieved using Swiftâ€™s property observers and game states, enabling real-time updates to the board and player positions. Multiplayer functionality allows either two players to compete locally or a single player to challenge the computer with AI-driven moves.

The app also incorporates iOS design guidelines with colorful graphics, sound effects, and haptic feedback to enhance the user experience. Animations built with SwiftUI transitions make the dice rolls and player movements engaging and visually appealing.

This project demonstrates the integration of object-oriented programming concepts, event handling, and UI design in Swift, making it an excellent learning example for iOS developers. Overall, the Snake and Ladder game brings a nostalgic experience into a modern mobile format, combining simplicity with interactive entertainment.
